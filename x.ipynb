    "## üìã Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as a comprehensive case study on **Simple Linear Regression**. The primary goal is to predict a student's final score based on the number of hours they studied. The project goes beyond a simple implementation by building the regression model using four distinct methods to provide a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Key Features & Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this project is the comparison of different approaches to solve a linear regression problem. The model was built using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) from Scratch:** Manually implementing the statistical formulas to calculate the optimal coefficients.\n",
    "2.  **Gradient Descent from Scratch:** An iterative optimization algorithm to find the model parameters by minimizing the cost function.\n",
    "3.  **The Normal Equation:** A direct, analytical solution using linear algebra to find the optimal parameters.\n",
    "4.  **Scikit-Learn Library:** Utilizing the industry-standard `LinearRegression` model for a quick and optimized implementation.\n",

    "## üìä Dataset\n",

    "* `Hours`: The number of hours a student studied.\n",
    "* `Scores`: The final score achieved by the student.\n",
